# Differentiable Mixed-Integer Programming Layers

This project is an implementation of Differentiable Mixed-Integer Programming Layers based on the neuromancer library. It introduces learnable differentiable correction layers for rounding and projection, enabling efficient integer solution acquisition for parametric nonlinear mixed-integer problems through neural networks, thus eliminating the need for traditional mathematical programming solvers.
